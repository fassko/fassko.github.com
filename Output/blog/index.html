With UIKit, we could do this with <code>presentViewController:animated:completion:</code> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/1621380-presentviewcontroller">function</a>. However, using SwiftUI, we need to twist our thinking towards using view or environment state, as the modal view is now called a sheet.</p></div></div><div class="blog-item"><h2><a class="blog-title" href="/blog/swiftui-launch-screen">Launch Screen with SwiftUI</a></h2><div class="blog-date">31 Oct 2020</div><div class="blog-content"><p>Launch Screen is the first interaction that users see when using our apps.

For instance, a countdown timer is a perfect example. A hidden gem is <code>CADisplayLink</code> - a special flavor of timer that is linked to the device screen refresh rate. Usually, it is 60 frames per second, but in new iPads, it is 120 frames per second.</p></div></div><div class="blog-item"><h2><a class="blog-title" href="/blog/clearing-subscriptions">Clearing up after subscribing to Swift WebSockets</a></h2><div class="blog-date">25 Feb 2020</div><div class="blog-content"><p>Opening and keeping a WebSocket connection alive isn't enough when dealing with it.

In addition to that subscriptions allow us to listen and to send messages from and to server in real-time. It is similar to regular queries, but the answer will be received when an event happens either on the server or on the client. Apollo iOS SDK library supports subscriptions and it is powered by the Swift WebSocket library <a href="/websockets-swift/">Starscream</a> behind the scenes to connect to the server.
